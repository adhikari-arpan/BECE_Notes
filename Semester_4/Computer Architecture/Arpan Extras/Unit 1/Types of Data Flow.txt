Types of data flow and operations within a computer system: 

1. I/O Directly Attached
- Explanation: This refers to input/output operations where a device is directly connected to the computer and communicates without involving storage.
- Example in Notes: A camera attached to a PC sends frames directly to a window displayed on the PC's screen.
- Diagram: Shows movement and control going directly between I/O and processing, bypassing storage.

2. I/O To/From Storage
- Explanation: This refers to data being transferred between an input/output device and the storage (such as memory or disk).
- Example in Notes: Playing an MP3 file stored in memory, with the audio output sent to earphones attached to the same PC.
- Diagram: Illustrates data path involving movement from storage to I/O and control handling the process.

3. Processing From/To Storage
- Explanation: This describes data being read from storage, processed by the CPU, and then the result is written back to storage.
- Example in Notes: Any number-crunching application that reads data from memory, processes it, and stores the result back in memory (e.g., calculation C = A + B).
- Diagram: Shows the control unit facilitating data flow from storage to processing and then back to storage.

In summary:
These points illustrate how data travels in a computer system during different types of operations: direct device I/O, data transfer between I/O devices and storage, and data processing that involves storage as both the input and output sources.
