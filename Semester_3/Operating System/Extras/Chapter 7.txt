### **Security Issues in an Operating System (OS)**  
An OS manages everything on a computer, so it must be secure. However, there are many threats, such as:  

1. **Viruses and Malware** – Harmful software that can damage files, steal data, or slow down the system.  
2. **Unauthorized Access** – Hackers can break into the system if passwords are weak or security settings are poor.  
3. **Privilege Escalation** – Attackers may gain higher permissions and take full control of the system.  
4. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks** – Overloading the system with requests to make it crash or slow down.  
5. **Code Injection** – Hackers inject harmful code to take control of the OS or steal information.  
6. **Data Theft** – If the OS doesn’t protect files properly, hackers can steal important data.  
7. **Weak Passwords** – If users set easy passwords, attackers can guess them and access the system.  
8. **Unpatched Bugs** – If the OS has security flaws and updates are not installed, attackers can exploit them.  
9. **Phishing & Social Engineering** – Tricking users into revealing passwords or installing malicious software.  

### **Ways to Install an Operating System (OS Deployment)**  

1. **Manual Installation** –  
   - Install the OS using a bootable USB or DVD.  
   - Good for personal computers but time-consuming for many systems.  

2. **Network Installation (PXE Boot)** –  
   - Install the OS over a network without needing USB/DVD.  
   - Used for multiple computers in offices or schools.  

3. **Disk Cloning** –  
   - Create a copy of an OS from one computer and install it on others.  
   - Fast method for setting up many computers with the same settings.  

4. **Virtual Machine Deployment** –  
   - Install the OS inside a virtual environment (like VMware, VirtualBox).  
   - Useful for testing new OS versions without affecting the main system.  

5. **Cloud-based Installation** –  
   - Install OS from the internet using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud.  
   - Mostly used for servers and online platforms.
