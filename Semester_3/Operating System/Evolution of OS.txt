EVolution of OS

Serial Processing Systems (Pre-1940s to 1940s)
Characteristics:
No operating system; jobs executed one at a time.
Programs run directly on hardware with no automation or resource management.
Users interacted with the system using punch cards or switches.
Limitations:
Manual setup for each job.
Time-consuming and error-prone.
Batch Processing Systems (1940s to 1950s)
Characteristics:
Jobs grouped (batched) and executed sequentially.
No interaction between user and job during execution.
Introduced Job Control Language (JCL) to manage batches.
Advancements:
Automated job scheduling improved efficiency.
Reduced idle time of computers.
Multiprogramming Systems (1950s to 1960s)
Characteristics:
Allowed multiple programs to reside in memory simultaneously.
CPU switches between programs to maximize resource usage.
If one program is waiting for I/O, another program uses the CPU.
Advancements:
Increased system utilization.
Early concepts of resource allocation and management emerged.
Time-Sharing Systems (1960s to 1970s)
Characteristics:
Enabled multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously.
Used time slices to switch between tasks, giving each user the impression of having their own machine.
Introduced terminals for direct user interaction.
Advancements:
Interactive computing became possible.
Led to the development of multi-user operating systems like UNIX.
Real-Time Systems (1970s to 1980s)
Characteristics:
Designed for applications requiring immediate response.
Two types:
Hard Real-Time: Strict timing requirements (e.g., flight control).
Soft Real-Time: Timing is important but not critical (e.g., video streaming).
Advancements:
Used in embedded systems, robotics, and industrial control.
Personal Computer Operating Systems (1980s to 1990s)
Characteristics:
Focused on single-user systems with graphical interfaces.
Examples: MS-DOS, Windows, macOS, Linux.
Advancements:
Made computing accessible to individuals.
Enhanced usability with GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces).
Distributed Systems (1990s to 2000s)
Characteristics:
Multiple computers work together as a single system over a network.
Focused on resource sharing, scalability, and fault tolerance.
Advancements:
Foundation for cloud computing and server clusters.
Mobile Operating Systems (2000s to Present)
Characteristics:
Specialized for smartphones and tablets.
Designed for touch interaction and optimized for low-power devices.
Examples: iOS, Android.
Advancements:
Created ecosystems for app development and mobile connectivity.
Cloud-Based and AI-Integrated Systems (2010s to Present)
Characteristics:
Virtualized operating systems running on cloud infrastructure.
Integrated with AI for automation, security, and resource optimization.
Advancements:
Scalability for modern applications.
Enhanced intelligence and predictive capabilities for user needs.
This timeline demonstrates the progressive evolution of operating systems to adapt to technological advancements and diverse user requirements.
