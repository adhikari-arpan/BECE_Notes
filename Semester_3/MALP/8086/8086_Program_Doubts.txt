#### What is @DATA and Why is it Moved into AX?

@DATA Explanation
@DATA is a label that represents the starting address of the data segment.
It is automatically generated by the assembler when you define a .DATA section.


#### Why Store it in AX First?

In 8086 architecture, you cannot directly move a segment address into DS.
Segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES) cannot be loaded directly from memory or an immediate value.
The CPU requires an intermediate register, usually AX.
