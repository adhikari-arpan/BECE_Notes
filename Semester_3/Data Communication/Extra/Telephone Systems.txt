1. What is a Telephone System?
A telephone system is a communication network that enables voice transmission between users over long distances. It consists of various components like telephone exchanges, transmission lines, switching equipment, and user terminals (phones).

2. Why is Hierarchy Needed in a Telephone System?
Hierarchies are needed in telephone systems to efficiently manage and multiplex multiple voice calls, ensuring smooth communication without interference or congestion. The hierarchy helps in:

Efficient bandwidth usage by grouping multiple calls together.

Scalability to accommodate a growing number of users.

Reliable communication by organizing signals into structured levels.

3. FDM in Analog Telephone Systems
In traditional analog telephone systems, multiple voice signals were transmitted over a shared medium using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM).

Each call was assigned a unique frequency band.

Guard bands were required to prevent interference.

Used mainly in old landline telephone networks.

4. TDM in Digital Telephone Systems
Modern telephone systems use Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) in digital networks.

Voice signals are converted into digital form using Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).

Multiple digital signals are transmitted in separate time slots over the same channel.

Used in modern mobile networks, VoIP, and fiber-optic communication.
