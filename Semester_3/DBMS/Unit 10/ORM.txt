What is ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?
ORM is a technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented approach. It acts as a bridge between an OOP language and an SQL database.

How Does ORM Work?
Instead of writing SQL queries, developers use objects in their code to interact with the database.
The ORM tool converts these objects into SQL queries automatically.
Data is retrieved as objects rather than raw rows and columns.
Popular ORM Frameworks
Hibernate (Java)
SQLAlchemy (Python)
Django ORM (Python)
TypeORM (Node.js)
Entity Framework (C#)


Advantages of ORM
Eliminates the need for SQL queries: Developers can work with objects instead of SQL commands.
Improves Code Maintainability: Business logic remains clean without being mixed with SQL queries.
Ensures Security: Reduces SQL injection risks by handling queries internally.
