## How It Works (Explained in Simple Steps)

### 1. Application
- This is the program created by the programmer.
- It could be a **game, simulation, or graphics software**.
- It uses **OpenGL functions** to draw things on the screen.

---

### 2. OpenGL API
- This is the **core library** that provides drawing functions (defined in **OpenGL.h**).
- These functions let you draw lines, triangles, apply textures, and more.
- OpenGL itself does not create windows — it only handles the drawing part.

---

### 3. Windowing API
- This is the **part that creates the window where graphics appear**.
- Different operating systems have their own windowing APIs:
    - Windows: **WGL**
    - Linux: **GLX**
    - Mac: **AGL, CGL, NSOpenGL**
- There are also cross-platform libraries like:
    - **SDL** (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
    - **GLUT** (easy OpenGL window creation)
- Or GUI toolkits with OpenGL support:
    - **wxWidgets, Qt, fltk, tcl/tk**

---

### 4. GLU Library (glu32.dll)
- This is an **optional helper library**.
- It gives extra functions to **simplify complex OpenGL tasks** (like creating perspective projections or drawing simple shapes).

---

### 5. Display Management System
- This is the **part of the operating system** that handles showing things on the screen.
- It manages how OpenGL graphics fit into the whole screen alongside other windows.

---

### 6. OpenGL Drivers
- These are the **drivers that talk directly to your hardware** (graphics card or GPU).
- Two types of drivers:
    1. **Hardware-Specific Driver:** Uses GPU for fast graphics.
    2. **Generic Software Driver:** Uses your CPU to draw if there’s no good GPU (much slower).
- What type gets used depends on:
    - What the programmer asked for (in the windowing API setup).
    - What hardware is actually present on the computer.

---

### 7. Hardware
- This is the **actual physical machine** — including:
    - Graphics Card (GPU)
    - Monitor/Display

---

## Summary Flow (Super Simple Version)
Programmer's App → OpenGL API → Windowing API → OpenGL Drivers → Graphics Card/CPU → Screen

---

### Key Point:
OpenGL **only handles drawing**. Creating windows, handling input (like mouse clicks), and managing events is handled by **Windowing APIs** or other **toolkits** like SDL, GLUT, Qt, etc.
