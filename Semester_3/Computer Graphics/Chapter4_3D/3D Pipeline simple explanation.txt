First of all, all objects like cars, trees, tigers, or houses are created in their own Modeling Coordinate System.

Each object has its own local coordinates, independent of others.
Next, we perform Modeling Transformation.

This step combines all objects into one common World Coordinate System — so now all objects exist in the same scene.
Now, we need to decide what part of this world we want to see — this is called Viewing.

For example, we set the camera at a particular place to look at the tiger and person.
After that, we perform Viewing Transformation.

This converts the objects from World Coordinates to Viewing Coordinates, which means shifting everything so that the camera is at the center, looking in the correct direction.
Right now, the scene is still in 3D, but our final screen is 2D.

To convert 3D into 2D, we perform Projection Transformation.
This gives us Projection Coordinates — a flat version of the scene.
Now, these projection coordinates need to fit into a standard box (a normalized space like -1 to +1).

This is done using Normalization Transformation.
This step ensures that no matter the actual size of the scene, it will fit properly into the screen later.
Finally, we do Workstation Transformation.

This step converts the normalized points into actual device coordinates (like screen pixels), so the scene can be displayed on your screen.
