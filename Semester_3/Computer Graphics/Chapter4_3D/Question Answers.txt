How is the consistency of geometric data table checked and what are the rules for generating error free polygon tables? (2022 Fall)

To ensure the correctness of geometric data tables (such as polygon tables in 3D modeling), various checks are performed. The goal is to detect errors like missing edges, incorrect connectivity, and improper orientation.

1️⃣ Consistency Checks
Vertex Consistency

Each edge should reference exactly two vertices.
The referenced vertices must exist in the vertex table.
Edge Consistency

Each polygon should reference a valid set of edges.
Each edge must be shared by at most two adjacent polygons.
Polygon Consistency

All edges of a polygon should form a closed loop (no gaps or overlaps).
The polygon should not self-intersect.
Orientation Consistency

All polygons should have a consistent normal direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).
Ensures proper rendering and lighting calculations.
Connectivity Check

The model should be a single connected component (unless explicitly designed otherwise).
Ensures all polygons are part of the same object.
Edge-Pairing Rule

Each edge must have exactly two incident polygons (except in open surfaces).
Ensures that no edge is left unreferenced or has incorrect references.
Non-Degeneracy Check

No polygons should have zero area (e.g., three collinear points).
No edges should collapse into a single point.
Rules for Generating Error-Free Polygon Tables
To prevent errors while constructing polygon tables, follow these best practices:

Ensure Correct Topology

Define proper connectivity between vertices, edges, and faces.
No missing or duplicate elements.
Maintain Planarity

Each polygon should lie in a single plane (especially for non-triangle meshes).
Helps avoid distortions in rendering.
Avoid Non-Manifold Geometry

A valid polygon mesh should not have edges shared by more than two faces.
Prevents issues in Boolean operations and smooth shading.
Use Consistent Vertex Order

Maintain a clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) order for all polygons.
Ensures proper normal calculations.
Check for Overlapping Faces

No two polygons should occupy the same space without being explicitly defined.
Avoids z-fighting in rendering.
Validate Edge Lengths and Angles

Avoid extreme differences in edge lengths to prevent distortion.
Ensure reasonable angles between connected faces.
Use a Data Validation Tool

Software tools (like mesh repair functions in Blender or CAD software) can automatically detect and fix errors.
